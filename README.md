**Challenges**

    🔴 Adding Itinerary
           While adding itinerary for each day for one tour, bit hard for me.And mapping
           to that particular tour.   
    🔴 Adding images to Database
             We need to send data from front end in form data format, that should match
             each format in the backend
    🔴 UI Enhancing
             To add transition or animation lottie to a page is bit challenging
    🔴Looping through itinerary
             To show a particular day itinerary for tour is like we need to iterate over and over
    🔴 Faced challenges in creating and mapping the enitites.
    🔴 While integrating front end and back end for POST and PUT request.
    🔴 Uploading image to the server and downloading image from the server.
    🔴 Faced challenge for @OnetoOne mapping for duplicate datas.


**Hardest Errors**

    🚩 Fixing 400 bad request error while itinerary 
             To send a image we need to send it in formdata format, but
             in form data we can't send it as array for that, for that we need to
             convert into string and set at backend by set it back as array and store.
    🚩 Internal server error for java persisitance exception for date - Solved it by converting the date format.🚩 Internal server error hibernate nested exception - Solved it by reworking on the modal mapping.
    🚩 Internal server error for delete nested entities - Solved it by adding cascade type ALL.
    🚩 Altering the entity and updating it.
    🚩 Handling logic for more than 1 row found for one to one mapping.
